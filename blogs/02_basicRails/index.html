                The rails were the first part that I had ever made, even when I was still following the idea of making a game.<br>
                I tried to put in some detail, but there wasn't that much I could do... as they are just rails<br>
                <br>
                And when I transitioned from making a game, to making a 3D printable model, I didn't really need to change anything, the small details that were left out, actually didn't matter that much.<br>
                <br>
                <div class="SmallTitle">Detail scale</div>
                At the right rail in the preview image, you can see those little nobs where the rail is connected to its base. Those were always there, and were never changed.<br>
                Because when I print them, they come out fairly well, and if not, it doesn't matter cause they arent in the way of anything.<br>
                And while there isn't much to "copy", I still tried to make them as close as I can to the real ones, while still being fully functional for what I need.<br>
                <br>
                <div class="SmallTitle">Scaling</div>
                Rails here in germany have a guage of about 1.435 meters, and mine have 10.2cm<br>
                I remember that I used some calculation for the train scale at least, to get it to be roughly the same on a certain scale, but I dont fully remember that anymore honestly.<br>
                And whenever I look at them when printed, I believe they turned out very well on that scale<br>
                <br>
                <div class="sideBySide">
                    <div class="SmallTitle">Straights</div>
                    Making the straight rail was of course the first and easiest part to make<br>
                    And to connect them, I made several different "clippers", that I can clip on 2 rails, so that I won't need to glue them together.<br>
                    They can be quite annoying sometimes to make, when the scale is off by some milimeters, but they mostly fit perfectly.<br>
                    They easily just clip onto the two rails on one base each and pull them together.<br>
