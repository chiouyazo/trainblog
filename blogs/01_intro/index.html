            <div class="SmallTitle">Why</div>
            <div class="NormalBody">
                I have a weird obsession with trains, and I also really like to understand how works, and see how they work in the future.<br>
                And due to work I have also developed a big interest in Artificial Intelegence, and how I can integrate them in peoples everyday life.<br>
                <br>
                <div class="SmallTitle">The original idea</div>
                I initially didn't start this project, to make a 3D model that I can actually print, and use IRL, but actually for a game idea I had.<br>
                A game where you would manage a whole city and build it up.<br>
                I had thought quite a lot about the game concept, and brought it very far.<br>
                <br>
                <div class="SmallTitle">Converting to 3D printing</div>
                But when I started to actually work on the train models for the game, I showed it to a friend, who has a 3D printer, and he just said "If you like you can print it here.".<br>
                And that's sort of how it started, I went through with his idea, and tried to print it.<br>
                I quickly realized that I was modeling it way too small and detailed for any printer. The picture of this blog is a render of the old car model.<br>
                But I was also quickly able to adapt to that, to make my builds bigger but still keep all of the detail I want.<br>
                <br>
                <div class="SmallTitle">The final concept</div>
                And then over time, I wondered "What if I would put a motor into it so I can drive it? And then automate it, so that it can drive by itself around a course.".<br>
                And that was the full idea, making a 3D printed train that can drive by itself using artificial intelegence.<br>
                <br>
                I fully started this project around about the 7th of may, and I'm writing this of the 16th of July.<br>
                So its been around 2 months, that I've been working on it already, and I would say that I have gotten pretty far already, even though I'm only doing this in my free time, while still managing my life.<br>
                <br>
                I'm making this blog to document my journey on it, and maybe even inspire someone, and build some contacts around this interest.<br>
                <br>
                And that is basically it!<br>
                All blogs following this one, will be about individual parts I've build, and what challenges I've had with them. And then eventually I will just document the continuation of what I am currently doing.<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <div style="display: block;">I will also make a blog about the money I've spend on this project so far, which you can find <a href="https://trainblog.chiouya.cloud/blogs/00_pricing/index.html">here</a></div>
            <div style="display: block;">You can find the newest blog on the <a href="https://trainblog.chiouya.cloud/"> homepage</a></div>
            <div style="display: block;">And the next blog in order <a href="https://trainblog.chiouya.cloud/blogs/02_basicRails/index.html">here</a></div>
